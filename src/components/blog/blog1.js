                    <p>For years, I felt so alone. I didn't know what was happening to me. Growing up, I felt like an outcast and abnormal. So, when I finally received a diagnosis last year of generalised anxiety disorder, I wanted to share my experiences to help and inspire others. It's so important to talk about mental health because you never know who is struggling and needs some positive energy to get through the next day.</p>
                    <p>“I've been called courageous and a blessing. People have thanked me for sharing my story and showing my vulnerability.”</p>
                    <p>I speak about my personal experiences of anxiety, depression and loss on platforms like Instagram. It got to a point where I thought to myself, enough is enough now – I need to turn my challenges into a positive to help others and succeed in life. Helping others is literally my life and I love it! I'm so thankful that I took that step, and I've managed to make a positive impact. That's all I've ever wanted since I was a little girl was to make people happy.</p>
                    <p>The reaction on Instagram has been very positive. I've been called courageous and a blessing. People have thanked me for sharing my story and showing my vulnerability. It's great to know I've been able to help people in this way, especially when I'm experiencing my own challenges. It brings me so much fulfilment in my heart when I am told these lovely comments. It means a lot to me.</p>
                    <p>Never-ending journey</p>
                    <p>I don't have many friends because I find it hard to get close to people and maintain relationships. I tend to self-sabotage and distance myself from loved ones because I don't feel good enough. I find it hard to be vulnerable because I still haven't accepted my mental health fully. It's a never-ending journey, but I don't give up.</p>
                    <p>I speak to the Samaritans and health professionals openly about my mental health on a regular basis. I am never judged, and there are times when I feel a lot of relief after speaking to someone. But for me crying is the best form of therapy. Sometimes you just have to let it all out and you most likely will feel a lot lighter after a good cry!</p>
